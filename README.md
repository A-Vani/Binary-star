# Binary-star
Find out if a multi (including binary) star system is bound or not.

Code to find if a multi star system is bound or not. First input the mass, relative position of the stars and their radial velocity. The code finds the center of mass of the system and uses it to calculate the kinetic energy and potential energy. If the ratio of KE/PE is <1 it is considered to be gravitationally bound system. The code also shows the system configuration in a simple plot
